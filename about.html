    <div class="card">
      <p>Hi, I’m a 16 year old autistic guy who's into web devleoping, computers, Linux, cybersecurity, tv preservation, cartoons, media servers, virtualization (vms and shit like docker) etc</p>
      <p>I just basically do what I like</p>
      <p>I have experience in the Linux operating system (specifically Arch Linux and Fedora), I also know how to use stuff like Docker and Podman, I run docker on my arch server. I'm also interested in Android app developing and media servers like Plex and Jellyfin.</p>
    </p> Call me crazy but my first linux distro I used was either Red Star, Ubuntu or Manjaro, I just can't remember lmao</p>
</p>I also preserve TV, mostly UKTV, I rip content from Box of Broadcasts and put them on YouTube</p>
<p>I live somewhere, but I won't tell ppl for opsec</p>
<p>That's basically all you have to know about me</p>
